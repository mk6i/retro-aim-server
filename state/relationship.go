// relationshipSQLTpl defines the template for a SQL query used to query buddy
// list and privacy relationships between a user (`me`) and other users in the
// system.
//
// This query serves two purposes:
// 1. Retrieve all relationships for the user.
// 2. If filtering is enabled (`.DoFilter` is true), retrieve all relationships
// filtered on a specific list of users.
//
// The query creates a unified view of both server-side buddy lists and
// client-side buddy lists.
